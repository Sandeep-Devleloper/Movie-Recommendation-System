Project Overview
The Movie Recommendation System allows users to input their preferences (like genres, keywords, actors, or directors), and based on those preferences, it generates a list of recommended movies. The recommendation algorithm uses content-based filtering to suggest movies similar to the userâ€™s input.

Due to high memory requirements, this project cannot be deployed on free platforms, but it can be run locally. Below are detailed instructions on how to set up and run the project.
